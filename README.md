## How to Execute with Quarkus Dev

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

4. Run the following command to start the application in development mode:

    ```shell
    ./mvnw quarkus:dev
    ```

    This will start the Quarkus development mode and automatically reload the application whenever changes are made.

## How to Play
